This is a fork to show some more advanced features: opening new windows and passing a datacontext, etc..

Find the `ClosableWindow` library source [here](https://bitbucket.org/giuliohome2015/closablewindow/src/240a4e8e9e3c50d8665436bd2c77ce6bb4720932/WinClosureLib/ClosableWindow.cs?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default)

Just to be clear this [elmish/Elmish.WPF](https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF) is one of the worst repo I've ever seen.
They say they are "opinionated", but they are simply ridiculous and idiotic.
What they say about WPF and XAML is completely misleading and it shows only their inexperience and ignorance.
Reading and playing with their fake and ugly software can seriously damage your reputation.
